i wandered lonely as a cloud
that floats on high oer vales and hills
when all at once i saw a crowd
a host of golden daffodils
beside the lake beneath the trees
fluttering and dancing in the breeze
continuous as the stars that shine
and twinkle on the milky way
they stretched in never ending line
along the margin of a bay
ten thousand saw i at a glance
tossing their heads in sprightly dance
the waves beside them danced but they
out did the sparkling leaves in glee
a poet could not be but gay
in such a jocund company
i gazed and gazed but little thought
what wealth the show to me had brought
for oft when on my couch i lie
in vacant or in pensive mood
they flash upon that inward eye
which is the bliss of solitude
and then my heart with pleasure fills
and dances with the daffodils
